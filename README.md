# odin-landing-page

This is a project to put into practice HTML and CSS concepts learned on the Odin Project.
It was build from zero to completion, following some guidelines on [the assignment for HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

[Click here to see the final result](https://sandromiczevski.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

In this project I tried to build a responsive web page using flexbox.
  
  - The page is responsive on widths ranging from 300px to 1000px. If the screen is over 1000px, the content will be centrelized on the screen.
  - Links are non-functional
